I made three files,one is have 10 walls ,and others are 20 walls and 40 walls,
for any file, it will run a loop,1000 particles,100 particles, 10 particles.

The red marker is robot's position,at begin ,it will start at a random position,
and the brown markers are the walls.

My world is a cycle world.

In sometimes, the program has some error,must be run the program again.
